Welcome to the wonderful world of WordPress meetup organizing!

### Before we begin

When you organize a local WordPress meetup, a number of responsibilities come along with that. The following content will cover all of that and give you some tips on how to encourage your community to be the best it can be.

### So how does this all work?

For your convenience, we have divided the content here into modules that will take you through all of the important areas for meetup organizers:

| **Module** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Being a Meetup Organizer** | Describes the principles that Meetup groups are based on and who the WordPress Meetup organizers are. |
| **Starting a Meetup Group** | Answers basic questions on starting a Meetup group and provides the WordPress Community’s best practices for event organization. |
| **Group Management** | Provides specific advice on handling an existing group and guidelines on what to do when something goes wrong. |


After each lesson, you will be presented with a quiz to test your knowledge of the material that we’ve covered. You’ll need to get all of the answers correct in order to move onto the next lesson, but don’t worry – you can retake the quizzes as often as you like in order to reach the goal of a 100% pass rate.
