# Meetup Program Basics

原文: [Meetup Program Basics – WordPress Community Self-Training](https://community-self-training.mystagingwebsite.com/lesson/meetup-program-basics-2/)

Meetups are part of the overall WordPress open source project. Just like a WordCamp, Meetups are a chance for people who love and value WordPress to get together. Whether it’s to learn about WordPress or meet others that work with it, Meetup events are a way to build a strong community from the ground up.

WordPress Meetups are community groups where anyone can show leadership; no single person is necessarily the owner of what can be organized and hosted. When your group [joins the Meetup chapter program](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/interest-form/), you agree that your group will follow a code of conduct, and agree to the [five good faith rules](https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/). To learn what it takes to be a Meetup organizer, read on for more information.

### What does it take to be an organizer?

Meetup organizers are reliable people who love WordPress that want to foster a local community. All event planning and organizing is done locally. You likely have an understanding of the level of local interest if you’ve spoken with people in your town that are involved in technology. You also may have noticed that they all come from a lot of different backgrounds. Events that are family-friendly and inclusive are incredibly important to the success of your local WordPress community!

Still not sure if you’re ready for the challenge? Read below about our Five Good Faith Rules, which were created by a group of volunteer meetup organizers.

### The Five Good Faith Rules

1.  WordPress Meetups are for the benefit of the WordPress community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.
2.  Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.
3.  Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers. In cases where a modest attendance fee might be necessary, this fee should only cover the costs of the meetup and shouldn’t be used to pay speakers or organizers.
4.  Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.
5.  Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.

### What if I’m already an organizer?

If you’re already an organizer of a WordPress meetup group, that doesn’t mean you can’t join the chapter program. There are a few things that may change when you do, but in general things stay the same. Some things you can expect:

WordPress Community Support takes over payment of dues for the group on meetup.com and is listed as the primary organizer. The original owner of the group is then listed as co-organizer (as are any existing co-organizers). WordPress now “owns” the meetup.com account, and everyone running events is on equal footing.

*   Organizers do not lose access to the group tools on meetup.com.
*   The group name and URL do not change.
*   The design of your site does not change (unless you are using a “fauxgo” or misspelling WordPress, in which case we’d ask you to fix that).
*   A survey is to all members and organizers of the group once a year to gather feedback. Survey results are then shared and discussed, so we can work together to figure out what to do to increase activity or happiness.
*   We can send you some WordPress swag to share with your group.
*   We can help cover the cost of venue rentals when donated space can’t be found. We are also working with meetup organizers to determine what costs and/or supplies could be provided by the central account to make organizing events easier.
*   If you currently require people to submit an application to join your group, we ask that you remove that requirement. WordPress meetup groups are open to all who are interested. You can still ask questions on the regular “join this meetup” form, but they shouldn’t be required.
*   We ask that any member of the group be allowed to organize events (this is a setting in group tools) rather than going through the co-organizers for approval. If someone wants to organize a Saturday morning WordPress coffee shop get-together that only 5 people attend and you want to organize a more formal presentation for 80 people, both of those types of events are equally valuable. The more people getting together and connecting to talk about WordPress, the better. Having only a few people organize events automatically limits their number and scope.
